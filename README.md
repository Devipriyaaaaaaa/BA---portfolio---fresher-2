# Pick It Up – Hyperlocal Delivery Business Analysis (Conceptual Case Study)

## 1. Business Problem
The hyperlocal grocery delivery platform faces frequent late deliveries and poor order tracking.
This causes customer dissatisfaction and loss of repeat orders.

## 2. Stakeholders
- Customers – need fast delivery and real-time order status.
- Local merchants – need accurate orders and simple inventory visibility.
- Delivery partners – need clear routes and timings.
- Platform/business – wants higher on-time delivery rate and revenue.

## 3. Current Process and Pain Points
- Orders are taken manually or via phone/WhatsApp.
- Merchants confirm stock slowly; drivers are assigned ad-hoc.
- Customers receive very few updates and only see delays at the end.

## 4. Proposed Improved Process
1. Customer places order through app or web.
2. System checks merchant inventory and sends instant confirmation.
3. Driver is auto-assigned based on distance and availability.
4. Customer sees live tracking and gets notifications for each stage.

## 5. Requirements

### Functional
- Customer app/web for ordering, order history, and tracking.
- Merchant panel for stock updates and order acceptance.
- Driver app for route, status updates, and proof of delivery.
- Basic integration with Zoho CRM/Analytics for customer and order data.

### Non-functional
- Target on-time delivery within 30–40 minutes in local area.
- High availability and simple mobile-friendly user interface.

## 6. Metrics and Expected Impact (Conceptual)
- Reduce late deliveries by about 25% through better assignment and tracking.
- Improve repeat orders and customer satisfaction scores.

## 7. My Role and Skills Used
- Defined problem statement, stakeholders, and pain points.
- Designed “as-is” and “to-be” process flows at a conceptual level.
- Listed key functional and non-functional requirements.
- Applied business analysis thinking, basic statistics, and structured, step-by-step explanation.
